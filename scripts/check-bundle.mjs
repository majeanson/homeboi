// C-23 (bmad/08) — the offline-aware bundle guard, run by CI after `npm run build`.
//
// Two things must never drift, and both have quietly broken elsewhere before:
//   1. SIZE — the eager entry (index-*.js) and every lazy chunk stay under a
//      budget, so a slow kitchen tablet keeps booting fast and a new import
//      can't silently drag a megabyte into the shell.
//   2. OFFLINE (load-bearing) — every JS chunk EXCEPT the online-only allowlist
//      is present in the generated sw.js PRECACHE list. The app lazy-loads ~40
//      routes; a kiosk that reboots OFFLINE must still open every one of them,
//      which only works if the service worker precached every lazy chunk.
//      Conversely the allowlisted online-only chunks (the 1.3 MB HEIC upload
//      decoder) must NOT be precached — that's the whole point of excluding
//      them. Keep ONLINE_ONLY in sync with ONLINE_ONLY_CHUNKS in vite.config.ts.
//
// Budgets are ~15-25% above today's real sizes — headroom for normal growth,
// tight enough that "oops, the whole guide landed in the shell" fails loudly.
